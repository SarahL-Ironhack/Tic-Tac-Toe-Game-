## Project Description
Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players alternate sketching a 'O' or a 'X' in one square of a nine-square grid. The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins. 

## Rules
- [First: #Draw the board: 3 x 3 grid.]
- [Second: #Have the first player go first: 'X' goes first.]
- [Third: #Have the second player go second with '0' symbol.]
- [Forth: #Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until no one can win.]
